## üõ†Ô∏è **Smart Upload Script**

Would you like me to create a script that:
1. **Analyzes your 1,828 images** using AI to score them by quality/composition
2. **Auto-categorizes** based on filename patterns and visual analysis
3. **Suggests the best images** for each website section
4. **Uploads only the curated selection** with proper metadata

This approach gives you:
- ‚úÖ **95% faster uploads** (140 vs 1,828 images)
- ‚úÖ **Better user experience** (curated quality over quantity)
- ‚úÖ **Faster website** (smaller image database)
- ‚úÖ **Easier management** (focused collection)
- ‚úÖ **Professional presentation** (every image has a purpose)

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Review your 1,828 images** and identify your absolute best work
2. **Organize into the priority structure** above
3. **Start with Phase 1** (40 critical images)
4. **Test the website** with curated selection
5. **Expand gradually** based on performance

Would you like me to create the smart selection script, or would you prefer to manually curate your best images first?
