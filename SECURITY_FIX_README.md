# 🚨 SECURITY LEAK FIXED - API KEYS REMOVED

## What was fixed:
- Removed exposed Google Firebase API keys from all files
- Replaced with placeholder values "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_HERE"
- Added security warnings in comments

## Files that were cleaned:
- `src/environments/environment.ts`
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` 
- `fix-image-data.js`
- `scripts/bulk-upload.ts`
- `database-setup.html`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NEXT STEPS:

### 1. Regenerate Your API Keys (REQUIRED)
The exposed API keys should be considered compromised. Generate new ones:
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings > General
4. Delete the old web app and create a new one
5. Get the new configuration

### 2. Update Your Local Files
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your new API keys in `.env.local`
3. Update the placeholder values in your config files with the new keys

### 3. Secure Your Repository
1. Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (if not already there)
2. Never commit real API keys again
3. Use environment variables for production deployment

## Security Best Practices:
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Keep `.env*` files in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use different keys for development and production
- ✅ Regularly rotate API keys
- ✅ Monitor Firebase usage for suspicious activity

## Firebase Security Rules
Make sure your Firebase security rules are properly configured to prevent unauthorized access even if keys are exposed.

**Remember: Frontend API keys are always visible to users, so proper Firebase security rules are your main protection!**
