# Documentation Index

All knowledge base files now live under `docs/` and are grouped by topic:

| Folder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `overview/` | High-level project documentation, historical progress, and design guides |
| `configuration/` | Platform configuration checklists (App Check, Storage rules, reCAPTCHA, etc.) |
| `operations/` | Deployment/optimization runbooks (image optimization, launch readiness) |
| `content/` | Content-mgmt specifics such as hero imagery and product reviews |
| `integrations/` | Third-party setup references (Stripe, Brevo, etc.) |
| `seo/` | SEO action plans, coordination guides, and reporting |
| `backend/` | Firebase Functions + backend automation notes |
| `internal/` | Working notes (`template.md`, `todo.md`, and similar) |
| `legacy/` | Archived status reports and historical implementation docs from the original build |

Each Markdown filename remained the same so existing anchors still work; only the root location changed.
